# LEGO Mindstorms EV3 Arm Controller

This app runs a simulation on Virtual Robotics Toolkit (VRT) through WiFi, just like the real robot.

If you want to run this sample, you need the Virtual Robotics Toolkit (VRT) project. You can find it [**here**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10Gw1xS2v8jqANcN9NUHJOkB6trNm8DRT/view?usp=sharing).

**Note:** take into account that VRT from time to time have some weird bugs. In this case, the first time the simulation is launched, motors B and C will not respond. For overcoming this, just close the **intelligent brick** window, stop the simulation, start it again and re-open the **intelligent brick** window. Also, please, check the [**VRT requirements for custom models**](https://www.virtualroboticstoolkit.com/documentation/sections/21/articles/100#).
